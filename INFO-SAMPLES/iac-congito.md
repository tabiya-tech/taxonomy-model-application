# How to Set Up AWS Cognito Using Pulumi

To set up AWS Cognito using Pulumi, you'll need to define and provision the necessary AWS resources and configurations using Pulumi's infrastructure as code (IaC) approach. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to set up AWS Cognito in Pulumi:

1. **Install Pulumi**:

   If you haven't already, install Pulumi by following the official installation guide: https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/

2. **Create a New Pulumi Project**:

   Create a new directory for your Pulumi project and initialize it:

   ```bash
   mkdir pulumi-cognito
   cd pulumi-cognito

   pulumi new aws-typescript
   ```

   Choose the appropriate programming language and stack (e.g., TypeScript). This command will create a basic Pulumi project structure for you.

3. **Install Required Dependencies**:

   In your project directory, install the AWS SDK and Pulumi AWS plugin:

   ```bash
   npm install @pulumi/aws
   ```

4. **Define Your AWS Cognito User Pool**:

   In your Pulumi project, create a TypeScript file (e.g., `cognito.ts`) and define your AWS Cognito User Pool. Here's a basic example:

   ```typescript
   import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
   import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";

   const userPool = new aws.cognito.UserPool("myUserPool", {
       name: "my-user-pool",
       usernameAttributes: ["email"],
       autoVerifiedAttributes: ["email"],
   });

   const userPoolClient = new aws.cognito.UserPoolClient("myUserPoolClient", {
       userPoolId: userPool.id,
       allowedOAuthFlowsUserPoolClient: true,
       allowedOAuthFlows: ["code"],
       allowedOAuthScopes: ["openid", "email", "profile"],
   });

   export const userPoolId = userPool.id;
   export const userPoolClientId = userPoolClient.id;
   ```

   Customize the user pool and client settings as needed for your application.

5. **Deploy Your Pulumi Stack**:

   Deploy your Pulumi stack to provision the AWS resources:

   ```bash
   pulumi up
   ```

   Pulumi will prompt you to authenticate with AWS and confirm the deployment. Once confirmed, it will create the AWS Cognito User Pool and User Pool Client.

6. **Access AWS Cognito Configuration**:

   You can access the configuration values of your AWS Cognito resources (e.g., User Pool ID and Client ID) from your Pulumi stack. For example, you can export these values in your TypeScript file:

   ```typescript
   export const userPoolId = userPool.id;
   export const userPoolClientId = userPoolClient.id;
   ```

7. **Use Cognito in Your Application**:

   You can now use the exported User Pool ID and Client ID in your application code to integrate with AWS Cognito. You can use the AWS SDK for JavaScript or a library like AWS Amplify to handle authentication and user management in your application.

8. **Destroy Resources (Optional)**:

   If you need to tear down the AWS Cognito resources provisioned by Pulumi, you can use the following command:

   ```bash
   pulumi destroy
   ```

   Confirm the destruction when prompted.

This guide provides a basic setup for AWS Cognito using Pulumi. You can further customize your Cognito setup, including defining user attributes, configuring advanced settings, and integrating it with other AWS services, depending on your application requirements.

# How to Set up Google 

In Pulumi, you can allow Google as an authentication provider for your AWS Cognito User Pool by configuring it as an identity provider in your Pulumi code. Here are the steps to set up Google as an identity provider for AWS Cognito using Pulumi:

1. **Install Dependencies**:

   Ensure that you have the `@pulumi/aws` package installed in your Pulumi project. You can install it using npm or yarn:

   ```bash
   npm install @pulumi/aws
   # or
   yarn add @pulumi/aws
   ```

2. **Import Required Modules**:

   In your Pulumi code (e.g., TypeScript or Python), import the necessary Pulumi modules and AWS resources:

   TypeScript:

   ```typescript
   import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
   import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
   ```

   Python:

   ```python
   import pulumi
   from pulumi_aws import cognito
   ```

3. **Create Your Cognito User Pool**:

   Define your Cognito User Pool as you normally would in Pulumi. Be sure to configure the user pool with the required settings and options:

   TypeScript:

   ```typescript
   const userPool = new aws.cognito.UserPool("myUserPool", {
       // Configure your user pool settings here.
   });
   ```

   Python:

   ```python
   user_pool = cognito.UserPool("myUserPool",
       # Configure your user pool settings here.
   )
   ```

4. **Create the Google Identity Provider**:

   In Pulumi, you can create the Google identity provider by configuring the `aws.cognito.IdentityProvider` resource and linking it to your User Pool:

   TypeScript:

   ```typescript
   const googleIdentityProvider = new aws.cognito.IdentityProvider("googleIdp", {
       providerDetails: {
           client_id: "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID",
           client_secret: "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET",
       },
       providerName: "Google",
       providerType: "Google",
       userPoolId: userPool.id,
   });
   ```

   Python:

   ```python
   google_idp = cognito.IdentityProvider("googleIdp",
       provider_details={
           "client_id": "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID",
           "client_secret": "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET",
       },
       provider_name="Google",
       provider_type="Google",
       user_pool_id=user_pool.id,
   )
   ```

   Replace `"YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID"` and `"YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET"` with your actual Google OAuth client ID and client secret.

5. **Deploy Your Pulumi Stack**:

   Deploy your Pulumi stack to provision the AWS Cognito resources:

   ```bash
   pulumi up
   ```

6. **Testing**:

   Test your authentication flow by running your application and verifying that you can sign in with Google as an identity provider.

By following these steps in your Pulumi code, you can configure Google as an identity provider for your AWS Cognito User Pool. This allows users to sign in to your application using their Google accounts.
