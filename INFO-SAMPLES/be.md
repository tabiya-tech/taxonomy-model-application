If you want to determine the user's role based on an existing user attribute in AWS Cognito, you can do so by reading the user's attribute during the Lambda trigger execution. Here's how you can modify the Lambda trigger function to read the user attribute and determine the user's role:

```javascript
exports.handler = async (event, context) => {
    const { userName, request } = event;

    // Retrieve the user's attributes
    const userAttributes = request.userAttributes;

    // Check if the user has a specific attribute (e.g., 'custom:department')
    const userDepartment = userAttributes['custom:department'];

    // Determine the user's role based on the userDepartment attribute
    let userRole = 'readOnly'; // Default role
    if (userDepartment === 'admin') {
        userRole = 'admin';
    } else if (userDepartment === 'manager') {
        userRole = 'manager';
    }

    // Set the custom attribute for the user
    request.userAttributes['custom:role'] = userRole;

    return request;
};
```

In this updated Lambda function:

1. We retrieve the user's attributes using `request.userAttributes`.

2. We check if the user has a specific attribute, such as `'custom:department'`, that contains information about the user's department or role.

3. Based on the user's department, we determine the user's role (`userRole`).

4. Finally, we set the custom attribute `'custom:role'` to the determined role.

With this Lambda function, you can determine the user's role by inspecting an existing user attribute (e.g., `'custom:department'`) and then assign the appropriate role based on your business logic. This allows you to dynamically assign roles to users during the sign-up process based on their attributes.
