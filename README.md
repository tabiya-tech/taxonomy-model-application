## Contribution Guidelines

ðŸŽ‰ Thank you for considering contributing to the Taxonomy Model App! ðŸŽ‰

### Code Quality

We aim to achieve the following metrics on SonarCloud:

- **Code Coverage**: 100%
- **Bugs**: 0
- **Security Rating**: A
- **Reliability Rating**: A
- **Maintainability Rating**: A
- **Security Hotspots Reviewed**: 100%


> Note: To run sonarcloud analysis locally you need to do the following:
> 1. set the SONAR_TOKEN environment variable to your sonarcloud token
> 2. ensure you have installed the sonar-scanner cli tool by running the following command at the projects root directory:
>   ```bash
>    yarn install
>    ```
> 3. run the sonarcloud the following command:
>    ```bash
>    yarn run sonar:local
>    ```
   
### **Code Formatting**

We follow the **[Prettier](https://prettier.io/)** code formatting guidelines to make sure the code is properly formatted in a uniform way.

You can find the configuration in the **[.prettierrc.json](@tabiya/prettier-config/.prettierrc.json)** file.

> **Note:**  
For Intellij IDEA, if you make any changes to the prettier config file, you many have to restart your IDE to make sure the changes are applied, before you can format the code using the IDE's formatting function.

### Conventional Commits

## Getting Started
To work with this repository you should have a system with a bash compatible terminal (linux, macOS, cygwin) as most of the scripts are written for bash and will not work on windows cmd or powershell. 

1. Fork the repository and clone it to your local environment.

2. Create a new branch for your changes.

3. After making your changes, ensure the code is clean, properly formatted and passes all tests.

    You can use the provided script, `run-before-merge.sh`, for assistance. This script performs checking of the code formatting, linting, building, and testing on the subprojects of the repository. The script also supports running sonarcloud analysis locally for the current branch and checks if it passes the quality gates. To run it, use the following command:
    
    ```bash
    ./run-before-merge.sh
    ```
   
   If you get any errors, fix them before proceeding.

4. Commit them, and push to your fork.

5. Use descriptive commit messages following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

6. Open a pull request to our main branch.

Happy contributing! ðŸš€
