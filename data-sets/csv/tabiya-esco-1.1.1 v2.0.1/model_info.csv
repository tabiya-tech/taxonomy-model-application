It incorporates previously overlooked activities such as micro-entrepreneurship and housework, which are often absent from conventional taxonomies. To ensure greater accessibility, we also introduced alternative labels, making this version more semantically approachable. See the release notes for more details.","v2.0.1-rc","true","### Version 2.0.1

- Improve the scope note for **5221_2 Microentrepreneur** to better reflect the nature of micro-entrepreneurship.

- Improve the scope notes and descriptions for **unseen economy occupations** to clearly distinguish between:

  (a) activities carried out within the worker’s own household or for family members, and

  (b) activities carried out in other households or for non-family members.

  The following occupations were updated: I31_0, I32_0, I33_0, I34_0, I35_0, I41_0, I42_0, I43_0, I44_0, I5131_0, I5132_0, I5133_0, I5134_0, I5135_0, I5136_0, I5137_0, I5141_0, I5142_0, I5143_0

### Version 2.0.0

- Copy activities from I3, I31–I37 and I4, I41–I43 to I513, I5131–I5137 and I514, I5141–I5143 as symmetrical counterparts.
  to the own household and family members activities, respectively and replace the activities I51_1, I51_2, I51_3, and I51_4, along with their hierarchies and skill associations.
- Introduce I52_5 (caring for and teaching children in the community) as a copy of I41_0 adjusted to refer to the community instead of family.
- Introduce occupation groups I513, I5131–I5137 and I514, I5141–I5143 as symmetrical counterparts to I3, I31–I37 and I4, I41–I43, but for other households and non-family members instead of own household and family members.
- **Breaking Change!**: Remove activities I51_1, I51_2, I51_3, and I51_4, along with their hierarchies and skill associations.
- Add descriptions of occupation groups I3, I4 and I5
- Fix(typo): ""think innovately"" -> ""think innovatively"" for the skill with UUID fe0c17db-89b4-4200-b9d2-95d8ea054e6d
- Update: Simplified short descriptions for the preferred labels of the unseen economy occupations/activities from the [ICATUS 2016 classification]
(https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic-social/time-use/icatus-2016/).
The preferred labels have been made more concise and easier to understand, while still retaining the essence of the original text.
