zoo curator","Zoo curators are usually the position of middle-management within an institution. Much of their work involves oversight, management and development of the animal collection. Often this is related to animal husbandry and welfare policy, the acquisition and disposition of zoo animals, and development of new exhibits. Zoos normally acquire animals through captive breeding programs. The zoo collection, trade, and transport of the animals is regulated by government agencies as well as guided by zoo membership organisations. Consequently, zoo curators act as a liaison between these agencies and the zoo itself. Additionally, they play an active role in the administration of zoo functions and all kinds of captive breeding programs."

language school teacher","Language school teachers educate non-age-specific students in a language that is not their native language at a specialised school, not bound by a level of education. They focus less on the academic aspect of language teaching, as opposed to language teachers in secondary or higher education, but instead on the theory and practice that will be most helpful to their students in real-life situations since most choose instruction for either business, immigration or leisure reasons. They organise their classes using a variety of lesson materials, work interactively with the group, and assess and evaluate their individual progress through assignments and examinations, putting emphasis on active language skills such as writing and speaking."
