# esco-v1.1.1 (en) v1.0.0

This model is essentially the original ESCO v1.1.1 (en) model from the official [ESCO website](https://esco.ec.europa.eu/en).

The entities in this model have been assigned UUIDs that have been released to third parties and must not be changed. When importing this model, it is essential that entities retain their UUIDs.

For this reason, this model should be imported as a **base model**.

Any models derived from this model should add the UUIDs from this model to the UUID history of their entities.
