The model is based on the [Tabiya (ESCO 1.1.1) v2.0.0](urn:tabiya:model:7e245bcb-f564-4bba-9ba3-68184164d250) and has the following changes:

- Change: Recalculate the hierarchy, skills relations, and skills' signaling value of [I32_0 cleaning or gardening](urn:tabiya:occupation:29adc332-58dc-4772-ab0d-e90eb4715372) and [I5132_0 cleaning or gardening](urn:tabiya:occupation:ff15fe29-3f90-4cec-9344-632820eec349)  after removing [I32_0_5](urn:tabiya:occupation:be886b8d-a8bd-487e-acca-f945ae3a74a2)

- Remove: skills [combine multiple fields of knowledge](urn:tabiya:skill:2c1f8eb5-ba88-4b2c-ad2a-381146a658d7) and [consider social impact of actions on service users](urn:tabiya:skill:87248c57-1f75-403d-8cc3-c4e1e3592ace) and related relationships.

- Remove: [I32_0_5 tending furnace, boiler, fireplace for heating and water supply](urn:tabiya:occupation:be886b8d-a8bd-487e-acca-f945ae3a74a2) from the unseen economy occupations/activities. This also involved removing the related occupation hierarchy and occupation-to-skill relationship records. Also, we adjusted the alternative labels, description, and scope note of aggregated occupations I32_0 and I5132_0

- Adapt the alternative labels of 1184 occupations and 31 skills to be more specific to South Africa."
