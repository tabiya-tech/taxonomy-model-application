Often this is related to animal husbandry and welfare policy, the acquisition and disposition of zoo animals, and development of new exhibits. Zoos normally acquire animals through captive breeding programs. The zoo collection, trade, and transport of the animals is regulated by government agencies as well as guided by zoo membership organisations. Consequently, zoo curators act as a liaison between these agencies and the zoo itself. Additionally, they play an active role in the administration of zoo functions and all kinds of captive breeding programs."

They focus on constructivist and ""learning through discovery"" teaching models, through which they encourage students to learn from first-hand experience rather than through direct instruction and thus provide the students with a relatively high level of freedom. They adhere to a specific curriculum that respects the students' natural, physical, social and psychological development. Montessori school teachers also teach classes with students differing up to three years in age in rather large groups, manage, and evaluate all the students separately according to the Montessori school philosophy."

Depending on the size of the organisation the education team may be a single person or a large team.
