Often this is related to animal husbandry and welfare policy, the acquisition and disposition of zoo animals, and development of new exhibits. Zoos normally acquire animals through captive breeding programs. The zoo collection, trade, and transport of the animals is regulated by government agencies as well as guided by zoo membership organisations. Consequently, zoo curators act as a liaison between these agencies and the zoo itself.
