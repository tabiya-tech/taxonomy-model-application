# Tabiya SA v1.1.1 v1.0.0

This model is based on the [tabiya-esco-1.1.1 v1.0.0](../tabiya-esco-1.1.1%20v1.0.0) with added alternative labels. The entities in this model have been assigned new UUIDs, while the original Tabiya ESCO 1.1.1 UUIDs are retained in their history.

The entities in this model have UUIDs that are used in the Release Notes, So we recommend importing it as a base model to retain the current UUIDs.

This model should be imported as a **base model**.
